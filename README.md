## 🧩 Development Process (Step-by-Step)

1. **Requirement Gathering**  
   - Identified navigation challenges in campus buildings  
   - Planned system architecture and key features

2. **System Design**  
   - Designed UML diagrams (Use Case, Sequence, Class)  
   - Created 3D models of the campus layout

3. **Tech Setup**  
   - Integrated Unity with ARKit/ARCore  
   - Configured Bluetooth beacons & Wi-Fi points for location triangulation

4. **Development Phases**  
   - Built AR overlay for indoor directions  
   - Implemented dynamic route rendering  
   - Enabled location tracking & POI markers

5. **Backend Integration**  
   - Connected to college database for room data  
   - Enabled real-time updates of routes and room details

6. **Testing**  
   - Unit Testing: Core modules  
   - Integration Testing: Syncing AR & positioning  
   - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): In a real college environment

7. **Deployment & Feedback**  
   - Finalized the build  
   - Deployed on Android device  
   - Collected user feedback for future improvements
